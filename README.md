# Code Contemporary's site set up on Eleventy

This is the new Code Contemporary site, built with Eleventy and Netlify CMS


## Based on Phil Hawksworth's EleventyOne

Phil's first port of call when starting another project using Eleventy.

This project scaffold includes:

- Eleventy with a skeleton site and some configs I use regularly
- A date format filter for Nunjucks
- Sass pipeline
- JS pipeline
- Serverless (FaaS) development pipeline with Netlify Functions for Lambda
